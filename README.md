# RRTestTask

### HowTo:

Firstly, you need to launch RRTestTask.Migrations, in order to create database and required table.  
For the sake of brevity and versatility, default location to create database is Desktop folder.  
Secondly, in appsettings.json you need to provide host, login and password to connect to IMAP mailbox.  
Gmail mailbox was created for testing, it's credentials are already filled in .json file.  
Lastly, you need to launch RRTestTask, and after it has finished working, database will be populated with records.
